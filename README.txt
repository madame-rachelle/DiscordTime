This simple program was created out of frustration of the lack of anything
else doing the same.

It's provided both as a utility and its simple algorithm as a reference for
anyone who wants to make something similar.

Why can't more programs be simple like this? Why does everything I see that
does something similar pull in massive unnecessary libraries that are extreme
overkill (not to mention massive inconvenience) for such a simple task?
That's why this program was created.
